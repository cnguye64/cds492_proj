CDS 492 Capstone Final Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use R to grow the number of annual memberships through analyzing user trends and offering suggestions to make the program more appealing to potential customers. More people will utilize this service if it can be identified where bikeshare is most popular and where to strategically build more stations. 

## Dataset

The dataset was taken directly from the official Capital Bikeshare website. The dataset contains all trips during April 2023. Each row is represented by a single trip and columns contains different variables of the trips: 

- rideable_type: Type of bike rode
- started_at: Start time of trip
- ended_at: End time of trip
- start_lat: Latitude where trip started
- end_lat: Latitude where trip ended
- start_lng: Longitude where trip started
- end_lng: Longitude where trip ended
- member casual: Whether trip was taken by a member with subscription or a single renter user
